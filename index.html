        <p>Dear Grandma,</p>
        <p>Happy Birthday!
It’s strange how life works sometimes. I still don’t know how, but somehow, after all these years, I ended up being one of your closest friends. It still feels a little surreal seeing your name at the top of my chats — “Ma’am Misbah — one of my closest friends.” Wow.
I always knew you had better students as friends — all highly capable, many of them so cool they even joined the army and stuff. I never thought you’d still remember Saif after all these years. I mean, who would remember that quiet, lonesome kid sitting beside the window at the back of the class? You had such amazing friends — why would you ever need Saif? Saif was a relic of the past, best left in the past.
“In the darkest hour, when the demons come, call on me, brother — and we’ll fight them together.”
But maybe God had other plans. Maybe He knew exactly when to bring that old relic from the past back. Maybe, for all these years, God was preparing me to be your friend — and to be a true one. Maybe if I’d come earlier, I wouldn’t have been mature (dead mature 😄) enough to handle a three-year-old!
I never knew you still remembered me so vividly, and I will forever be grateful for that. I’ve found a good friend — one who reminded me that kindness still exists.
Life had already shown me the true colors of people. I stopped trusting easily — there was always a catch, always a price to pay, always someone who wanted something in return. But then, you reminded me that genuine connections never fade. That even after years apart, some bonds stay alive — quietly waiting for the right time to return.
You’ve shown me that friendship isn’t about constant presence, but about the kind of understanding that time can’t erase. You remembered me when you didn’t have to, and that says everything about the kind of person you are — warm, selfless, and full of heart. It’s rare to meet someone who sees beyond the years, beyond the distance, and still chooses to care.
Through the calm and the storm, through laughter and silence — I’ll always be around. You never have to walk through the dark alone again. And if you ever feel lost, just look back — you’ll find me in that same old classroom by the window, waiting with the same quiet smile, ready to listen, ready to help, ready to fight your battles with you if needed.
So, on your birthday, I just want you to know how truly special you are — not just to me, but to everyone whose life you’ve touched. You’ve guided, cared, and inspired in ways that words can never truly describe.
You are more than just a friend to me — you are family.

        <p>-Yours truly Batman from basement and one last thing Ghafoorrrrr!</p>
